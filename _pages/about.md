I am currently a second-year PhD student at Princeton, where I'm a member of the [Programming Languages Group](https://pl.cs.princeton.edu/). I graduated from Swarthmore College in 2018 with High Honors, with majors in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently working with my advisor, [Dave Walker](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/), on NV, an intermediate language for verification of network control planes.

## Research Interests

My interests tend towards formal verification, type theory, program transformations, and programming language design. I am particularly interested in finding ways to automatically simplify programs to aid in verification.
